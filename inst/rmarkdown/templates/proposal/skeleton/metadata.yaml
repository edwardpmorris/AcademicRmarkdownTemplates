description: <
 "The Coastal Earth Observation Network (CEON) project aims to strengthen CEI·MAR's capacity
 to provide a range of services related to the exponential expansion in the availability of
 Open Acess Earth Observation (EO) data. Building on the experience of the EU project FAST,
 which provides EO products to support cost-effective, nature-based shoreline protection
 against flooding and erosion in coastal zones.
 CEON aims to;
 1) Refine and develop the Calibration/Validation activities developed in FAST,
 2) Develop complimentary EO products for coastal regions,
 3) Develop a demonstration 'Processing on Demand' service, and
 4) Foster links between the CEI·MAR EO community.
 Delivering a strong knowledge infrastructure (code base), capacity building (training materials)
 and scientific publications documenting EO product development, calibration and validation,
 the expected impact of CEON is improved competitiveness in the era of 'Big EO Data'. With
 special emphasis on the European Earth Observation Programme, Copernicus, working with
 ESA's Coastal Thematic Initiative and the Sentinel validation teams, as well as the continued
 support of FAST partners... "
